If it deduces that the \npressure of that tyre has fallen below the \npredefined limit of the system, the warning \nlight in the instrument pack will illuminate \n(always yellow). For more information, please \nrefer to ‘Instrument Pack’ in ‘Instruments \nand Controls’ section. TPMS can remind \nyou of low tyre pressure, but it can not \nreplace normal tyre maintenance. For tyre \nmaintenance, please refer to ‘Tyres’ in \n‘Maintenance’ chapter. If the TPMS malfunction indicator \nlamp illuminates, and the warning message \n“XX Tyre Pressure Low” is accompanied \ndisplayed, it is advised that you please stop \nthe car as soon as possible, check the tyre \npressure and inflate the tyre to correct \npressure value.
