It is of equal importance for passengers in the rear seat to fasten their seat belts correctly. Otherwise, passengers with seat belts not correctly fastened will be thrown forward in accidents, and will endanger themselves as well as the driver and other passengers.\n\nWhen the vehicle is in motion, the travelling speed of the occupants is identical to that of the vehicle. In the event of a 'head on collision' or emergency braking, the vehicle may stop, but the occupants will carry on travelling until they come into contact with a stationary object. This object may be the steering wheel, dashboard, windscreen or front seats.\n\nA correctly fastened seat belt will eliminate this risk of injury.

It provides assistance to the driver, it DOES NOT replace any of the drivers responsibilities. When using the adaptive cruise control system, it is important that the driver maintains concentration at ALL times and is prepared to take action. Otherwise, accidents or personal injuries may occur.\n\n<a id='0329e920-93f9-416d-9a88-27e56fbeefc9'></a>\n\nThe adaptive cruise control system can automatically switch between constant speed cruise and car following cruise depending on whether it can detect a vehicle directly ahead. Constant speed cruise controls the vehicle at a certain speed range. Car following cruise operates by setting the distance between the vehicle and the vehicles directly ahead.\n\n<a id='8d1871d9-5e8b-4fe4-b77f-a4c76d970dcf'></a>\n\nWhen activated if the adaptive cruise control system detects a vehicle in the same lane directly ahead it may accelerate or gently apply braking of the vehicle to maintain the set following distance.\n\n<a id='9ae413f1-3e4a-4b2d-b9c7-145e79d11e57'></a>\n\nNote:The adaptive cruise control system\nis designed for highways and roads in\ngood condition.

A red car is in the lower lane, moving forward (indicated by a black arrow pointing up). Directly in front of the red car, within its lane, is a yellow rectangular area, suggesting its immediate path or active zone. Extending diagonally from the sides of the red car are two orange triangular areas, indicating a wider detection zone or blind spot. In the upper lane, a green car is also moving forward (indicated by a black arrow pointing up). The lanes are separated by dashed white lines, and there's a solid white line on the far left edge of the road.: figure::>\n\n<a id='96110286-159e-44b3-9f9b-fde51884f5ab'></a>\n\n178",

This allows manual gear selection. Use a lower gear selection to aid the slowing of the vehicle and thus avoiding over-use of the brakes. If a threshold is reached, the vehicle will automatically shift up, in these cases use of the brakes to slow the vehicle is necessary, at the same time re-select the lower gear.",

The TCS monitors the driving speed of each wheel individually. If spin is detected on one wheel, the system automatically brakes that wheel, transferring torque to the opposite, non-spinning wheel. If both wheels are spinning, the system will reduce the output torque of the power system in order to regulate wheel rotation until traction is regained.",

It is of equal importance for passengers in the rear seat to fasten their seat belts correctly. Otherwise, passengers with seat belts not correctly fastened will be thrown forward in accidents, and will endanger themselves as well as the driver and other passengers.\n\nWhen the vehicle is in motion, the travelling speed of the occupants is identical to that of the vehicle. In the event of a 'head on collision' or emergency braking, the vehicle may stop, but the occupants will carry on travelling until they come into contact with a stationary object. This object may be the steering wheel, dashboard, windscreen or front seats.\n\nA correctly fastened seat belt will eliminate this risk of injury.

In this case, allow the seat belt to retract slightly and then pull it across your body slowly.\n* If it is difficult to pull the seat belt out, it may be due to twisted webbing. If this is the case, fully extract the seat belt, remove the twist, allow the seat belt to retract slowly.\n* When using the rear seat belts please ensure they are fully retracted into the correct position to avoid jamming in the rear seat catches. It is a legal requirement to wear seat belts. Even if the seat belt is twisted it must be worn. Where possible avoid the twisted section contacting the body and seek advice from an MG Authorised Dealer as soon as possible.\n\n<a id='4f49fa2c-9787-4765-986a-c5ed0d1d5bd9'></a>\n\nCorrect Routing of the Seat Belts !

Under certain conditions, it will allow the transmission to shift to a lower gear immediately, and provide fast acceleration. Once the accelerator pedal is released, it will resume a suitable higher gear (based on the vehicle speed and the position of the accelerator pedal).\n\n<a id='1741734a-30fb-4c1c-825f-9345480cffd6'></a>\n\nDriving on Hills\n\n! In cases where a short stop on a hill is required, such as a traffic jam, DO NOT momentarily apply the accelerator to prevent \"roll back\". This could cause the automatic transmission to overheat and result in damage.\n\n<a id='d27b5062-805c-4d86-afb9-e77525c6b3fd'></a>\n\n## Hill Start\n\nIn case of hill start, the starting aid function of the EPB can be used to prevent from slipping. With the seat belt safely fastened, press the brake pedal, apply the EPB, and engage into the desired gear (D/R/S), then release the brake pedal; press the accelerator pedal for start-off, the EPB will automatically deactivated for starting aid.\n\n<a id='22102b4a-fa9f-4fb3-b8a5-465b17547b19'></a>\n\nYou can also use the hill hold control function\nto hill start.

Use a lower gear selection to aid the slowing of the vehicle and thus avoiding over-use of the brakes. For example, when driving down the hill with continuous curves, engage into 2 gear; when driving down the straight hill, engage into 3 gear. If the brake force of engine is insufficient, the speed is increased, the automatic transmission will shift to high gear automatically to avoid the overrunning of the engine, at this time, you need to press the brake pedal immediately and shift to appropriate low gear through manual mode.\n\n<a id='6cb2ae5f-ec30-41c2-9b7c-5b590a6fdcd1'></a>\n\n141\n\n<a id='89255143-de01-479a-805a-365d0275ef96'></a>\n\n4\n\n<a id='44b2c902-95a3-4e94-a0bf-f66ca6f1e52d'></a>\n\nStarting & Driving\n\n<a id='0dfa0b1a-a7bb-467c-892a-434f4de9691b'></a>\n\nP Gear Emergency Release\nWhen the START/STOP Switch is on and the brake pedal is pressed, if the shift lever cannot be moved out of P gear, turn off the START/ STOP Switch, and apply the EPB.

It provides assistance to the driver, it DOES NOT replace any of the drivers responsibilities. When using the adaptive cruise control system, it is important that the driver maintains concentration at ALL times and is prepared to take action. Otherwise, accidents or personal injuries may occur.\n\n<a id='0329e920-93f9-416d-9a88-27e56fbeefc9'></a>\n\nThe adaptive cruise control system can automatically switch between constant speed cruise and car following cruise depending on whether it can detect a vehicle directly ahead. Constant speed cruise controls the vehicle at a certain speed range. Car following cruise operates by setting the distance between the vehicle and the vehicles directly ahead.\n\n<a id='8d1871d9-5e8b-4fe4-b77f-a4c76d970dcf'></a>\n\nWhen activated if the adaptive cruise control system detects a vehicle in the same lane directly ahead it may accelerate or gently apply braking of the vehicle to maintain the set following distance.\n\n<a id='9ae413f1-3e4a-4b2d-b9c7-145e79d11e57'></a>\n\nNote:The adaptive cruise control system\nis designed for highways and roads in\ngood condition.
