If it deduces that the\npressure of that tyre has fallen below the\npredefined limit of the system, the warning\nlight in the instrument pack will illuminate\n(always yellow). For more information, please\nrefer to 'Instrument Pack' in 'Instruments\nand Controls' section. TPMS can remind\nyou of low tyre pressure, but it can not\n\n<a id='05ea0328-16dc-4437-929a-0a1beeae55d7'></a>\n\nreplace normal tyre maintenance. For tyre\nmaintenance, please refer to 'Tyres' in\n'Maintenance' chapter.\n\n<a id='2472bcd9-18a4-459d-a6cc-c61ff57a8112'></a>\n\n<::transcription of the content\n: figure::>\n\nIf the TPMS malfunction indicator lamp illuminates, and the warning message \"XX Tyre Pressure Low\" is accompanied displayed, it is advised that you please stop the car as soon as possible, check the tyre pressure and inflate the tyre to correct pressure value. Driving with under-inflated tyres, the tyre will overheat and cause tyre fault. Using under-inflated tyres increase more energy consumption and result in shorter tread life, and may affect vehicle handling and braking performance. Always check/adjust tyre pressures when they are cold. The tyre pressure label attached to the vehicle indicates the correct amount of tyre inflation required for your vehicle when the tyre is cold.\n\n<a id='05bee173-aaff-4f1c-a0e1-05b0afafe5de'></a>\n\n**TPMS Self-learning**\nWhen replacing a TPMS sensor and receiver,\nor performing tyre rotation, TPMS self-\nlearning is required, please consult an MG\nAuthorised Dealer for details.\n\n<a id='22a8e36a-bbd3-4b18-ac66-cae873d6c0d7'></a>\n\nLoad Carrying\n\n⚠️ DO NOT exceed the gross vehicle weight or the permitted front and rear axle loads.

Check the pressure of the spare wheel to avoid flat tyre as it is not used for a long time. Always check tyre pressures after changing a wheel.\n\n! After replacing the wheel, you must tighten the wheel bolts to the specified torque (120 ~ 130Nm).\n\n1. Before raising the vehicle, use the vehicle tool to remove each wheel bolt cap. Use the wheel spanner to slacken the bolt half a turn anti-clockwise.\n2. Turn the jack handle in a clockwise direction until the tyre is clear of the ground.\n\n<a id='6a4b87e2-f6bd-4002-858e-c2f5700bdc90'></a>\n\nNote: For your safety, please put the\nspare tyre under the vehicle body\nflanging area near the jack.\n\n<a id='f00b686f-c26e-4999-8934-19a8b460d492'></a>\n\n_**Avoid the outer side of the wheel contacting the ground, and the rim surface may be scratched.**_\n\n3. Remove the wheel bolts and place them in the toolbox to prevent them from being lost. Make sure the vehicle is steady and there is no risk of slip or movement before removing wheel bolts.\n4. Remove wheels.\n\n<a id='6f679098-9a6d-44d5-82c8-42f2bdf0e946'></a>\n\n**Note:** *Replace the spare wheel with the removed wheel and place it under the vehicle body flanging area near the jack. Avoid the outer side of the wheel contacting the ground, and the rim surface may be scratched.*\n\n5 Fit the spare wheel and tighten the wheel bolts until the wheel is seated firmly against the hub.\n\n6 Lower the vehicle and remove the jack, then FULLY tighten the wheel bolts in a diagonal sequence.\n\n7 Finally, stow the tools back into the tool tray, and put the replaced wheel into the well under the trunk floor (with the wheel rim facing down).\n\n<a id='9ecfdf61-b98e-458c-b4f0-32cfd7f927c3'></a>\n\n190\n\n<!-- PAGE BREAK -->\n\n<a id='f8d8556d-563c-4d24-a6a4-aab7276a05d4'></a>\n\nEmergency Information\n\n<a id='28f63430-b976-4d31-979b-08e371fbf9e3'></a>\n\nNote: DO NOT stand on the handle of the wheel bolt spanner or use extension tube on the handle of the spanner.\n\nNote: When replacing the wheel, please fully tighten the bolts in the diagonal sequence in 2 times.\n\nNote: Contact an MG Authorised Dealer to replace with a new tyre urgently.\n\nSpacesaver Spare Wheel\n\n! Only one spacesaver spare wheel can be used at any one time, otherwise the operational performance and brake performance may be reduced, thereby leading to accident or injury to yourself and others.\n\n! When driving on icy or slippery surfaces it is advised to fit the spacesaver wheel to the rear of the vehicle to maintain adaquate stability. This may mean swapping a front wheel with a rear wheel.\n\n! Snow chains can not be used on the spacesaver spare wheel, this can cause damage to the car and snow chain.\n\nWhen the spacesaver spare wheel is fitted, the vehicle speed should not exceed 80 km/h. Please have the full-scale tyre repaired and replace the spare wheel as soon as possible. This will extend the life span of the spare wheel for other emergencies.\n\n<a id='738d5e2f-7baa-4027-9aee-45f6d8ca3af5'></a>\n\nNote: DO NOT use an automatic car wash when the spacesaver wheel is fitted, the guide rails of the car wash may conflict with the wheel/tyre and cause damage.\n\n<a id='973dea28-a0bf-4711-9059-f73e415eb367'></a>\n\n*Steel wheel is provided as spare wheel.\n#Spare tyre can be from any manufacturer.\n\n<a id='4ff867f0-03b4-4dfb-b7d0-c55ed7be2532'></a>\n\n191\n\n<a id='4fda5958-c125-4799-8eec-2673c00deb53'></a>\n\n5\n\n<!-- PAGE BREAK -->\n\n<a id='ab1c7f63-7785-4b1c-8ce3-46387ceb9475'></a>\n\nEmergency Information\n\n<a id='78b9f776-4c56-4380-adfc-b97c21ba81b1'></a>\n\n# Fuse Replacement\n## Fuse\nFuses are simple circuit breakers which protect the vehicle electrical equipment by preventing the electrical circuits from being overloaded.

If it deduces that the\npressure of that tyre has fallen below the\npredefined limit of the system, the warning\nlight in the instrument pack will illuminate\n(always yellow). For more information, please\nrefer to 'Instrument Pack' in 'Instruments\nand Controls' section. TPMS can remind\nyou of low tyre pressure, but it can not\n\n<a id='05ea0328-16dc-4437-929a-0a1beeae55d7'></a>\n\nreplace normal tyre maintenance.

Driving with under-inflated tyres, the tyre will overheat and cause tyre fault. Using under-inflated tyres increase more energy consumption and result in shorter tread life, and may affect vehicle handling and braking performance. Always check/adjust tyre pressures when they are cold. The tyre pressure label attached to the vehicle indicates the correct amount of tyre inflation required for your vehicle when the tyre is cold.\n\n<a id='05bee173-aaff-4f1c-a0e1-05b0afafe5de'></a>\n\n**TPMS Self-learning**\nWhen replacing a TPMS sensor and receiver,\nor performing tyre rotation, TPMS self-\nlearning is required, please consult an MG\nAuthorised Dealer for details.\n\n<a id='22a8e36a-bbd3-4b18-ac66-cae873d6c0d7'></a>\n\nLoad Carrying\n\n⚠️ DO NOT exceed the gross vehicle weight or the permitted front and rear axle loads.

Check the pressure of the spare wheel to avoid flat tyre as it is not used for a long time. Always check tyre pressures after changing a wheel.\n\n! After replacing the wheel, you must tighten the wheel bolts to the specified torque (120 ~ 130Nm).\n\n1. Before raising the vehicle, use the vehicle tool to remove each wheel bolt cap. Use the wheel spanner to slacken the bolt half a turn anti-clockwise.\n2. Turn the jack handle in a clockwise direction until the tyre is clear of the ground.\n\n<a id='6a4b87e2-f6bd-4002-858e-c2f5700bdc90'></a>\n\nNote: For your safety, please put the\nspare tyre under the vehicle body\nflanging area near the jack.\n\n<a id='f00b686f-c26e-4999-8934-19a8b460d492'></a>\n\n_**Avoid the outer side of the wheel contacting the ground, and the rim surface may be scratched.**_\n\n3. Remove the wheel bolts and place them in the toolbox to prevent them from being lost. Make sure the vehicle is steady and there is no risk of slip or movement before removing wheel bolts.\n4. Remove wheels.\n\n<a id='6f679098-9a6d-44d5-82c8-42f2bdf0e946'></a>\n\n**Note:** *Replace the spare wheel with the removed wheel and place it under the vehicle body flanging area near the jack. Avoid the outer side of the wheel contacting the ground, and the rim surface may be scratched.*\n\n5 Fit the spare wheel and tighten the wheel bolts until the wheel is seated firmly against the hub.\n\n6 Lower the vehicle and remove the jack, then FULLY tighten the wheel bolts in a diagonal sequence.\n\n7 Finally, stow the tools back into the tool tray, and put the replaced wheel into the well under the trunk floor (with the wheel rim facing down).\n\n<a id='9ecfdf61-b98e-458c-b4f0-32cfd7f927c3'></a>\n\n190\n\n<a id='f8d8556d-563c-4d24-a6a4-aab7276a05d4'></a>\n\nEmergency Information\n\n<a id='28f63430-b976-4d31-979b-08e371fbf9e3'></a>\n\nNote: DO NOT stand on the handle of the wheel bolt spanner or use extension tube on the handle of the spanner.\n\nNote: When replacing the wheel, please fully tighten the bolts in the diagonal sequence in 2 times.\n\nNote: Contact an MG Authorised Dealer to replace with a new tyre urgently.\n\nSpacesaver Spare Wheel\n\n! Only one spacesaver spare wheel can be used at any one time, otherwise the operational performance and brake performance may be reduced, thereby leading to accident or injury to yourself and others.\n\n! When driving on icy or slippery surfaces it is advised to fit the spacesaver wheel to the rear of the vehicle to maintain adaquate stability. This may mean swapping a front wheel with a rear wheel.\n\n! Snow chains can not be used on the spacesaver spare wheel, this can cause damage to the car and snow chain.\n\nWhen the spacesaver spare wheel is fitted, the vehicle speed should not exceed 80 km/h. Please have the full-scale tyre repaired and replace the spare wheel as soon as possible. This will extend the life span of the spare wheel for other emergencies.\n\n<a id='738d5e2f-7baa-4027-9aee-45f6d8ca3af5'></a>\n\nNote: DO NOT use an automatic car wash when the spacesaver wheel is fitted, the guide rails of the car wash may conflict with the wheel/tyre and cause damage.\n\n<a id='973dea28-a0bf-4711-9059-f73e415eb367'></a>\n\n*Steel wheel is provided as spare wheel.\n#Spare tyre can be from any manufacturer.\n\n<a id='4ff867f0-03b4-4dfb-b7d0-c55ed7be2532'></a>\n\n191\n\n<a id='4fda5958-c125-4799-8eec-2673c00deb53'></a>\n\n5\n\n<a id='ab1c7f63-7785-4b1c-8ce3-46387ceb9475'></a>\n\nEmergency Information\n\n<a id='78b9f776-4c56-4380-adfc-b97c21ba81b1'></a>\n\n# Fuse Replacement\n## Fuse\nFuses are simple circuit breakers which protect the vehicle electrical equipment by preventing the electrical circuits from being overloaded.
